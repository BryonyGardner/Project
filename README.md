# Project
### Data Science and Machine Learning module individual project
### **JAL34**
This is a tool written in Python for exploring the DNA sequence of JAL34 (nucleotide frequency and GC content) and translating nuclotide sequences into proteins.
To run:
1) Download the Jupyter notebook in the repository along with the fasta files for the jal34 gene sequence (At3g16460.fasta) and JAL34 protein sequence (O04310.fasta) into a single directory. 
2) The data can also be downloaded from:
      DNA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_003074.8?report=fasta&from=5592491&to=5595912
      Protein: https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O04310.fasta
3) The script will also work with different genes. If using a dataset, edit the file names in the code and use the matching fasta files.
